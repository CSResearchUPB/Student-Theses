# Projects Description 2017 - 2018

1) IoT Analytics Smart Greenhouses:

# Title: Sensor machine learning for anomaly detection 
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student(s) will work on the analytics engine to extend the current anomaly detection 
mechanism. The user will implement and extend known machine learning algorithms on multiple datasets, both real and 
synthetic in order to refine and extend the effectiveness of the system.

Keywords: sensor machine learning, synthetic data, data generator, time series modelling, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing

2) Scalability in Big Data Systems
# Title: Application profiling based on machine learning techniques
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student(s) will extend the current work of an application that provisions services
in a Hadoop cluster. The objective is to build a scalable web application that will interact with the Hadoop cluster in order to allow 
the users to manage Hadoop job service level agreements and statistics
Keywords: big data, service provisioning, web applications, Hadoop, scalability

2) Telecom network automation:

# Title: Design and build a machine learning application that automates telecom network troubleshooting activities
# Description: Using machine learning algorithms (supervised and unsupervised learning), the student(s) will develop an application that
correlates both spatial and temporal data and generates new rules to automate network troubleshooting activities.

Keywords: machine learning, automation, network troubleshooting, big data

3) Smart News:

# Title: News rating app
# Description: As part of a news platform, the student(s) will work on the rating engine and build an application that aggregates
and rates news articles or posts according to several criteria (e.g. content quality, news agencies backing it up, references used). 
The application will use NLP and similarity algorithms and will have a mobile/web interface.

Keywords: machine learning, NLP, Big Data, distributed processing
