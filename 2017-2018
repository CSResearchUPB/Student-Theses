# Projects Description 2017 - 2018

1) Scalability in Big Data Systems

# Title: Scalable Web Application for SLA management in a Hadoop cluster
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student(s) will build a scalable web application that interacts with a Hadoop 
cluster and allows administrators to manage job SLAs (service level agreements).
# Keywords: big data, service provisioning, web applications, Hadoop, scalability, service level agreements

2) Telecom network automation:

# Title: Machine learning engine that automates network troubleshooting activities
# Description: Using machine learning algorithms (supervised and unsupervised learning), the student(s) will develop an application that
correlates spatial and temporal data and generates new rules to automate network troubleshooting activities.
# Keywords: machine learning, automation, network troubleshooting, big data

3) IoT Analytics Smart Greenhouses:

# Title: Sensor machine learning for anomaly detection 
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student(s) will work on the analytics engine to extend the current anomaly detection 
mechanism. The user will implement and extend known machine learning algorithms on multiple datasets, both real and 
synthetic in order to refine and extend the effectiveness of the system.
# Keywords: sensor machine learning, synthetic data, data generator, time series modelling, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing

4) Smart News:

# Title: News rating app
# Description: As part of a news platform, the student(s) will build an application that aggregates
and rates news articles or posts according to several criteria (e.g. content quality, sentiment analysis, news agencies reputation, 
references used). The application will use NLP and similarity algorithms and will have a mobile/web interface.
# Keywords: machine learning, NLP, Big Data, sentiment analysis, news
