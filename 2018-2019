# Projects Description 2018 - 2019 in collaboration with Ericsson Romania

2) IoT & Telecom Smart networks:

# Title: Clustering site profiles
# Description: Using machine learning algorithms (supervised and unsupervised learning), the student(s) will develop an application that
correlates spatial and temporal data to build profiles of telecom sites and try to predict certain things like the possibility of a future outage.
# Keywords: machine learning, automation, network troubleshooting, big data

# Title: Network map visualizer
# Description: The student(s) will develop a geographic information system (GIS) application that will offer the possibility to visualize entire network information 
on a map. The challenge is to choose the technologies so that large volumes of data will be shown in the user interface
# Keywords: automation, network visualization, big data, GIS, performance tuning

# Title: Android - Web Chat
# Description: The student(s) will develop a messaging solution with chat, audio and video capabilities exposed via two clients: a web version and an Android version. The application needs to be reliable in slow data coverage.
