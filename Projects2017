B) IoT Analytics Smart Greenhouses:

# Project no 2.1
# Title: Sensor based real-time machine learning application
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student(s) will work on the analytics engine and build an application that models 
real-time sensor data using distributed machine learning techniques. The application will automatically adjust itself to the volume 
and nature of streaming data.

Keywords: sensor machine learning, time series modelling, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing, data sampling, real-time processing

# Project no 2.2
# Title: Sensor machine learning for anomaly detection 
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student(s) will work on the analytics engine to extend the current anomaly detection 
mechanism. The user will implement and extend known machine learning algorithms on multiple datasets, both real and 
synthetic in order to refine and extend the effectiveness of the system.

Keywords: sensor machine learning, synthetic data, data generator, time series modelling, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing

# Project no 2.3
# Title: Root cause analysis in sensor networks.
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student(s) will build an application that clusters (distance-based) sensor data. 
The application will use this information to  code logic for Root cause analysis on specific events streamed by a 
network of sensors. The application will contain a map interface to present insights.

Keywords: sensor machine learning, clustering, data fusion, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing

# Project no 2.4
# Title: Monitor the greenhouse environment using semantic and sensor data
# Students: 2 BS / 1 MS
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student will build an application that offers real-time contextual information 
in a greenhouse environment. Objectives of the work are: a) Model a plant ontology b) Correlate plant knowledge with sensor data
c) Raise alerts to adminstrators d) Reason new rules

Keywords: real-time processing, ontology reasoning, IoT, Big Data, data modelling

C) Scalability in Big Data Systems

# Title: Automatic service provisioning in Big Data systems
# Students: 2 BS / 1 MS
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student will extend the current work on an application that provisions services
in a Hadoop cluster based on the current and forecasted utilization. The objectives of the work are: a) Extend current tests in a
larger cluster b) Define more abstract components to scale (Processing/Storage/Messaging) c) Use machine learning for smarter scaling 
decisions.

Keywords: IoT, Big Data, service provisioning, Hadoop clusters, machine learning, scalability

D) Distributed engines for IoT middleware

# Title: Design and build a distributed integration system using the actor model
# Students: 1 or 2 BS / 1 MS
# Description: Inspired by the current Big Data platform, the student will design and build a prototype of a distributed 
integration system. The system will be implemented using the actor model programming paradigm and the Akka framework.

Keywords: distributed system, Akka framework, Hadoop clusters, real-time integration, Big Data

# Title: Design and prototype a distributed IoT middleware solution
# Students: 1 or 2 BS / 1 MS
# Description: The student will design and prototype an integration middleware solution to be used in Big Data/IoT environments. 
The purpose of the solution is to offer an integration environment for multiple type of components (Hadoop and non-Hadoop) with 
different roles in a IoT architecture.

Keywords: distributed system, IoT middleware, Hadoop clusters, real-time integration, Big Data
