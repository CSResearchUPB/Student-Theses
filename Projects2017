# Title: Articles rating app

B) IoT Analytics Smart Greenhouses:

# Project no 2.1
# Title: Sensor based real-time machine learning application
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student(s) will work on the analytics engine and build an application that models 
real-time sensor data using distributed machine learning techniques. The application will automatically adjust itself to the volume 
and nature of streaming data.

Keywords: sensor machine learning, time series modelling, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing, data sampling, real-time processing

# Project no 2.2
# Title: Sensor machine learning for anomaly detection 
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student(s) will work on the analytics engine to extend the current anomaly detection 
mechanism. The user will implement and extend known machine learning algorithms on multiple datasets, both real and 
synthetic in order to refine and extend the effectiveness of the system.

Keywords: sensor machine learning, synthetic data, data generator, time series modelling, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing

# Project no 2.3
# Title: Root cause analysis in sensor networks.
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student(s) will build an application that clusters (distance-based) sensor data. 
The application will use this information to  code logic for Root cause analysis on specific events streamed by a 
network of sensors. The application will contain a map interface to present insights.

Keywords: sensor machine learning, clustering, data fusion, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing

C) Scalability in Big Data Systems

# Project no 3.1
# Title: Application profiling based on machine learning techniques
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student(s) will extend the current work of an application that provisions services
in a Hadoop cluster based on the current and forecasted utilization. The objective of the work is to use machine learning techniques 
to profile and predict future application usages.
Keywords: IoT, Big Data, service provisioning, Hadoop clusters, machine learning, scalability

# Project no 3.2
# Title: Automatic service provisioning in Big Data systems
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student(s) will extend the current work on an application that provisions services
in a Hadoop cluster based on the current and forecasted utilization. The objective of the work is to simulate multiple applications 
running in parallel and implement a security mechanism to isolate the applications.
Keywords: IoT, Big Data, service provisioning, Hadoop clusters, machine learning, scalability

D) Distributed engines for IoT middleware

# Project no 4.1
# Title: Design and build a distributed integration system using the actor model
# Description: Inspired by the current Big Data platform, the student(s) will design and build a prototype of a distributed 
integration system. The system will be implemented using the actor model programming paradigm and the Akka framework.

Keywords: distributed system, Akka framework, Hadoop clusters, real-time integration, Big Data
