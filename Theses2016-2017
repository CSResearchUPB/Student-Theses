# Theses Description 2016 - 2017

A) IoT Analytics Smart Greenhouses:

# Title: Automatic data sampling for sensor based machine learning
# Students: 1 BS
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student will work on the analytics engine and build an application that models 
real-time sensor data using distributed machine learning techniques. The application will automatically adapt and adjust the 
computation sampling to the volume of streaming data.

Keywords: data sampling, machine learning, time series modelling, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing

# Title: Real-time machine learning for anomaly detection 
# Students: 1 BS
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student will work on the analytics engine to extend the current machine learning 
anomaly detection mechanism. The user will implement and extend known machine learning algorithms on multiple datasets, both real and 
synthetic in order to refine the effectiveness of the system.

Keywords: data sampling, machine learning, time series modelling, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing

3) Collocate and cluster (distance-based) sensor data for root cause analysis
