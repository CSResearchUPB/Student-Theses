# Theses Description 2016 - 2017

A) IoT Analytics Smart Greenhouses:

# Title: Sensor based real-time machine learning application
# Students: 1 BS
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student will work on the analytics engine and build an application that models 
real-time sensor data using distributed machine learning techniques. The application will automatically adjust itself to the volume 
and nature of streaming data.

Keywords: sensor machine learning, time series modelling, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing, data sampling, real-time processing

# Title: Sensor machine learning for anomaly detection 
# Students: 1 BS
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student will work on the analytics engine to extend the current anomaly detection 
mechanism. The user will implement and extend known machine learning algorithms on multiple datasets, both real and 
synthetic in order to refine and extend the effectiveness of the system.

Keywords: sensor machine learning, synthetic data, data generator, time series modelling, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing

# Title: Root cause analysis in sensor networks.
# Students: 1 BS
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the user will build an application that clusters (distance-based) sensor data. 
The application will use this information to  code logic for Root cause analysis on specific events streamed by a 
network of sensors. The application will contain a map interface to present insights.

Keywords: sensor machine learning, clustering, data fusion, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing


# Title: Monitor the greenhouse environment using semantic and sensor data
# Students: 2 BS / 1 MS
# Description: As part of a Big Data platform, the student will build an application that offers real-time contextual information 
in a greenhouse environment. 
  - Model a plant ontology
  - Use sensor data to correlate information
  - Reason new rules
