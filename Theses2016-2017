IoT Analytics Smart Greenhouses:

1) Automatic data sampling for sensor based modelling - 1 student

As part of a Big Data platform, the student will work on the analytics engine and build an application that models real-time sensor 
data using distributed machine learning techniques. The application will adapt and adjust the computation to the volume of 
streaming data.

Keywords: data sampling, machine learning, time series modelling, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing

2) Using a time series generator extend the reasoning experiments on multiple domains - 1 student

As part of a Big Data platform, the student will work on the analytics engine to extend the current machine learning anomaly detection 
mechanism. The user will implement known machine learning algorithms on multiple datasets, both real and synthetic in order to refine
and prove the effectiveness of the system.

Keywords: data sampling, machine learning, time series modelling, IoT, Big Data, distributed processing

3) Collocate and cluster (distance-based) sensor data for root cause analysis 

Semantic IoT for Greenhouses:
1) IoT Smart Farming: Monitoring the environment using semantinc and sensor data - 2 students / 1 M Student
  - Model a plant ontology
  - Use sensor data to correlate information
  - Reason new rules

Distributed processing systems:
1) Build a distributed processing system using the Akka framework (Actor Model) - 1 student

IoT Middleware:
1) Design and build an IoT middleware using an integration framework - TBD

Scalability in Big Data Systems

1) Automatic Service Provisioning in Hadoop Clusters - 2 students / 1 M student
 - Extend current tests to GRID5000.
 - Define more abstract components to scale (Processing/Storage/Messaging)
 - Use machine learning for smarter scaling decisions
